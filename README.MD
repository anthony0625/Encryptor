To encrypt a quote, edit the quote variable and run the program. The boolean used when declaring the encoder "test" controls whether or not the key will be displayed at the end. Changing the value to false will disable the conversion key from being displayed. The encoder will automatically remove all spaces, commas, apostrophes and periods (Keep in mind that apostrophes in a string must follow a backslash). Numbers and other special characters such as asterisks, semi-colons, etc. will not be removed by the encoder class.
